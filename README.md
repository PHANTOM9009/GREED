# About the game:

you must have played many games against each other or against computers, but ever wondered how two computers will
look competing against each other? ofcourse computers can't think for themselves yet, but you can make them think
by writing efficient and smart algorithms.

This game is a powerful set of API's and graphics that enable you to write AI/ML algorithms in C++ to compete 
against other algorithms.
