 GREED is a part of [AI_PLAYGROUNDS](https://aiplaygrounds.in).
 
 GREED is a real time strategy game, for which you will write an AI agent in C++, your AI player will need to manage your Battleship to strategically manage       
 resources and destroy other ships to emerge as the winner.

You are free to choose any strategy ranging from Tree search, deep reinforcement, to Game theory.

With GREED we are changing the way programmers compete and sharpen their skills, by providing them an engaging platform. GREED currently supports C++ , support for more languages is coming soon.

So brace yourself to watch your code performing in front of you!

And one more thing..
This game is in alpha testing stage, if you want to be a part of alpha testing and become a contributor to this project, just raise an issue and we will get back to you.

Is it necessary to know Machine learning to play this game ?

No, this challenge is all about your programming, problem solving, game theory, and analytical thinking skills. But if you've already got some skills in ML and think you can apply them in this challenge - go ahead!




## Concept:
  You need to program your battleship to destroy other battleships, cannons, loot gold and make your battleship to be the last one standing.
  Your scores after a match is calculated on the overall performance of your battleship, for more information check out [Rules](Rules.md).

## prerequisite:
  1. visual studio (to run your algorithm): We don't force you to write in our boring editors, Write code and compete in your favorite IDE! 
  2. windows OS (64 bit)
  3. high speed internet connection ( for online games you will need 40mbps+ upload speed to play the game smoothly)
     

NOTE: sample algorithms and template program are enclosed in "sample algorithms" folder in the repository, you can use them for reference.
for more details refer to:
