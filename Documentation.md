		-> updates the cost of the coord "ob" as passed as a parameter to the new_cost in the local map of the player
			These changes are not made in the original map, but in your local map for your navigation.
			the more the cost of a tile, your ship has less probability of taking that path.
   			the navigation path is calculated using your local map because the cost of each tile can be tuned by the player.
      			The global map with default cost is used to deduct your fuel, fuel is deducted according to the global/default costs
	 		for all the players.
